## What This Project Fixes

When `model_provider` changes, Codex history often looks "lost" even though the underlying thread data is still there.

In practice, the usual problem is metadata drift:

- rollout files say one thing
- SQLite says another
- the sidebar project list is missing paths that still have threads behind them

Typical symptoms:

- old threads disappear after switching provider
- `codex resume` and Codex App disagree
- threads still exist, but the sidebar project vanishes until you manually use `Add Project`

`codex-threadkeeper` realigns the metadata that drives visibility:

- rollout files in `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions`
- SQLite thread state in `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`
- sidebar project state in `.codex-global-state.json`
- managed backups in `~/.codex/backups_state/threadkeeper`

It does not replace Codex itself. It fixes thread visibility and recovery metadata around Codex.

## How It Differs From The Original Provider-Sync Tool

This repo is now maintained as an independent project, not just a lightly renamed provider-sync helper.

The practical differences are:

- it restores missing sidebar projects, not just rollout and SQLite provider fields
- CLI sync shows stage-by-stage progress instead of looking hung
- sync summary reports backup creation time
- Windows lock-directory creation retries transient `EPERM` races
- runtime namespaces now live under `threadkeeper`
  - backups: `backups_state/threadkeeper`
  - lock path: `tmp/threadkeeper.lock`
  - GUI settings: `%AppData%\\codex-threadkeeper`
- old `provider-sync` backups are no longer auto-discovered, but can still be restored by passing the legacy path explicitly
- GUI, CLI, and Windows launcher flows are all still supported

## Daily Usage

These are the only flows most people need day to day.

| Situation | Command | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inspect current state | `codex-threadkeeper status` | you want to see current provider plus rollout/SQLite distribution |
| Repair visibility only | `codex-threadkeeper sync` | you already switched provider elsewhere and only need history to line up |
| Switch provider and sync | `codex-threadkeeper switch <provider-id>` | you want one command to update `config.toml` and sync history |
| Roll back a sync | `codex-threadkeeper restore <backup-dir>` | you synced to the wrong provider or want to undo a run |
| Remove old backups | `codex-threadkeeper prune-backups --keep 5` | you only want to keep the newest managed backups |

For normal Windows users, the GUI is the easiest daily path:

1. Open `CodexThreadkeeper.exe`
2. Click `Refresh`
3. Pick the target provider
4. Click `Execute`

If you prefer CLI, the normal repair flow is:

```bash
codex-threadkeeper status
codex-threadkeeper sync
codex-threadkeeper status
```

If you want to switch provider at the same time:

```bash
codex-threadkeeper status
codex-threadkeeper switch openai
codex-threadkeeper status
```

## A Typical End-To-End Run

First close anything that may still be using `.codex`:

- Codex
- Codex App
- `app-server`
- terminals that still hold an active session file open

Then run:

```bash
codex-threadkeeper status
codex-threadkeeper sync
```

The most important fields in the sync summary are:

- `Updated rollout files`
- `Added sidebar projects`
- `Updated SQLite rows`

Those three numbers tell you whether the run repaired rollout metadata, sidebar visibility, and SQLite state.

Run `status` again after that. If rollout and SQLite provider counts now agree, the repair is usually complete.

## Install

### CLI

```bash
npm install -g github:panjinhe/codex-threadkeeper
```

Requirements:

- Node.js `24+`
- standard `~/.codex` layout
- currently tested primarily on Windows

### GUI

If you do not want Node or terminal commands, download `CodexThreadkeeper.exe` from Releases.

GUI-specific notes are in [README_GUI_ZH.md](README_GUI_ZH.md).

## Command Quick Reference

```bash
codex-threadkeeper status
codex-threadkeeper sync
codex-threadkeeper sync --keep 5
codex-threadkeeper sync --provider openai
codex-threadkeeper switch openai
codex-threadkeeper switch apigather
codex-threadkeeper prune-backups --keep 5
codex-threadkeeper restore C:\Users\you\.codex\backups_state\threadkeeper\20260319T042708906Z
codex-threadkeeper install-windows-launcher
```

With an explicit Codex home:

```bash
codex-threadkeeper status --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
codex-threadkeeper sync --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
codex-threadkeeper switch openai --codex-home C:\Users\you\.codex
```

## Common Cases

### `state_5.sqlite is currently in use`

Usually Codex is still open.

Close Codex / Codex App / `app-server`, then rerun the same command.

### `Skipped locked rollout files`

Usually an active session still has one or more rollout files open.

That means:

- SQLite probably already synced
- most rollout files probably already synced
- only the still-locked files were skipped

End that active session and rerun `codex-threadkeeper sync` later if you want a fully clean rewrite.

### I still have old `provider-sync` backups

That is fine. They are no longer auto-discovered, but you can still restore one explicitly:

```bash
codex-threadkeeper restore C:\Users\you\.codex\backups_state\provider-sync\20260319T042708906Z
```

## Safety Boundaries

This tool edits metadata, but it does not replace Codex itself.

It does not:

- manage `auth.json`
- log you into third-party providers
- rewrite message bodies
- rewrite titles or timestamps
- clean up unmanaged legacy backup folders as if they belonged to this tool

Default runtime paths:

```text
~/.codex/backups_state/threadkeeper/<timestamp>
~/.codex/tmp/threadkeeper.lock
```
